Under the Mid Week Pay Loans proposed ATR provisions in which lenders would pull borrowers’ credit reports, use a real-time database, and have an estimate of similar people’s expenses, $1,250 and $500 loans, repayable in 10 and five months for $2,450 and $595 in fees, respectively, would probably continue to be offered. The bureau’s commentary on the proposed rule stated that most payday installment loan borrowers would pass an Mid Week Pay Loans test for monthly payments of more than $300, which is larger than the monthly payments for many payday installment loans and more than borrowers say they can afford.
